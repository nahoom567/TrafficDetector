# Traffic Detector
This project focuses on implementing a traffic detection system to pinpoint high-traffic zones within Karmiel, gathering pertinent data for subsequent analysis, with the ultimate objective of mitigating traffic issues in these identified areas.
The collaboration between our school, a local university, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute University led to the development of the app dedicated to data collection.

# features
1. Users can choose their preferred mode of transportation from options including private vehicle, bike, walking, or public bus.
2. The system captures crucial trip details such as current location, time of trip, and trip route.
3. Each trip, along with user details, is stored in the MongoDB database for subsequent analysis.
